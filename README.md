# Handover Implementation : Virtualized Evolved Packet Core (v-EPC) 

v-EPC is a simple virtualized form of Long Term Evolution Evolved Packet Core (LTE - EPC). It simulates the working of a typical EPC for User Equipment session creation, termination, handover and paging. 
Being motivated by the fastly growing concept of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), v-EPC is built to help researchers see the benefits of employing NFV in the EPC.
